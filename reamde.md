### Interactive learning of concept based models 

In this project we have implemented Concept Bottlenect Model (CBM) with Active Learning. The neural network architecure is displayed in the following Figure.

The source folder contains the python and the jupyter_notebooks folder contains the order of running the experiment to train and test the model.  
*Train_CBM_CUB.ipynb* contains the required step to train the CBM model and *Test_CBM_CUB.ipynb* file contains the instructions involved in testing the model with the test dataset.  
*CUB_AL.ipynb* file contains the code segment of active learning framework and the output for active learning.
The trained models are saved as pickle file in the saved_models folder which can be loaded for furthure use.
